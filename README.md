# MRI-NIRS_Pipeline

Processing pipeline for image reconstruction of fNIRS data.

## Before you start:

* Digitization templates can be created using the digitizeR package (www.github.com/samhforbes/digitizeR). This has it's own set of instructions.
* Keep the repository up to date on github and link the scripts/matlab folder into the matlab path
* Copy the ANTS folder (see ‘misc’) to the applications folder on your computer
* You will also need working versions of Homer2 and AtlasViewer

From there, follow the steps in the NeuroDOT_Pipeline_Instructions.docx found in the *files* subfolder.
